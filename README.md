## What is the Alphacast's Open-Source Connectors?

1. This Connectors are the script behind Alphacast verified datasets. We review and validate the code to confirm that they do what they say they do. The code is then run routinely (hourly, daily, weekly) to keep the data updated on our Certified Datasets.

2. We have begun the process of opening our Connectors. Explore the repositories to find examples, ideas and inspiration! All the code and data created in this project will be open and free! You can also use the codes in this Connectors to create you own datasets and repos with them.

3. Anyone can upload, share and monetize their data in Alphacast but please, read the Terms & Conditions. Don't share or upload data that you do not own or that you do not have the right to share.

4. We support the work of our contributors. Write to hello@alphacast.io to learn more about this. If you like to contribute with this repository please follow the guidelines in: https://github.com/alphacastio/connectors-main
